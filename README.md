### **1. Azure Resource Inspector**

**Description:**
Azure Resource Inspector is a Go-based CLI tool that connects to Azure using the official SDK to list and analyse cloud resources across subscriptions and resource groups. It provides a quick overview of deployed resources, filtered by type, region, or tag, and supports multiple output formats such as JSON, YAML, and human-readable tables.
This project aims to simplify environment auditing, assist with Terraform validation, and provide a foundation for automated infrastructure reporting.

**Key Features (planned):**

* Enumerate Azure resources across subscriptions or resource groups.
* Filter results by resource type or tag.
* Export output in table, JSON, or YAML format.
* Optional integration with Terraform for state comparison.
* Parallelised resource fetching for faster results.

Would you like me to also draft short **GitHub repository names** and one-line taglines (for the repo description section) so you can set them up cleanly too?
